## How to teach what you really want to learn?
```Monica Hoff```

### 1. Teach beyond the possible
### 2. Accept that the whole process can be a collective learning experience by bringing people together right from the beginning.
### 3. Learning has its own time.
### 4. Accept your ignorance.
### 5. Appreciate what you know.
### 6. Questioning if the subject is of common interest.
### 7. Go beyond correct answers, look for responsible answers.
